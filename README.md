In this project, I extensively used CSS and its styling features, and I also added three basic JavaScript functionalities. The main function of my project is to create a sports synthesis application. 
I started with a simple navigation menu, incorporating links within sections. One of the important features of the navigation is its strike-through style, and I minimized the navigation bar.
When the time came, I made it into a hamburger menu using JavaScript. When the hamburger menu is toggled, the navigation links are activated and set to work correctly. 
Below this, I added a section where I used JavaScript to add click events to buttons. When clicked, the buttons fetch different JPEG files, changing the image within the page accordingly.

I also added a BMI calculator underneath. After entering values into the form, it performs certain calculations and, based on specific conditions, displays your BMI value on the page as inner text.
It informs you whether you are normal, overweight, obese, or extremely obese. If no value is entered, the page also warns you with an inner text message that says "Please enter a valid value." 
I then continued with another section, where I added a "Contact Us" part. I integrated a working map here, adding a location as well, and included it as a sponsor on my page.
Throughout the development of my page, I paid attention to responsive features. I made sure the page was stylish, that the CSS was as neat as possible, and that it met the project requirements.
Thank you.
